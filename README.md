Parts of the logic have been taken from the original CM3D2.EditMenuFilter plugin. Much of the UI has code has been factored out into a separate library.

## Installation

**COM3D2 only**. Original CM is not supported.

To install, extract folder from the release zip file inside your BepInEx/plugins folder.
